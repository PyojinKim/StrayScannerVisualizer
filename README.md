## Usage

To access the data from your iOS device, see [this wiki entry](https://github.com/kekeblom/StrayVisualizer/wiki/Accessing-Data).
It is noteworthy that the reliable (effective) depth range is up to about 4.5 m as described [here](https://www.it-jim.com/blog/iphones-12-pro-lidar-how-to-get-and-interpret-data/).
In my personal experience, iPhone/iPad LiDAR (depth map) shows much better depth quality than Intel RealSense L515.
